# OrangePi_BM
A simple LED Blinker for the Orange Pi Zero H2+/H3 using uboot and bare metal programming.


Update:

Adding project files.
Made for the Orange Pi Zero, this flashes the Red and Green LEDs
Use Eclipse to build

Use the following to build otherwise:
arm-none-eabi-gcc -marm -Os -fPIC  -g -Wa,-adhlns="main.o.lst" -MMD -MP -MF"main.d" -MT"main.o" -c -o "main.o" "../main.c"


arm-none-eabi-g++ -marm -Os -fPIC  -g -T "linker.ld" -nostartfiles -nodefaultlibs -nostdlib -Xlinker --gc-sections -Wl,-Map,"OrangePi_BM.map" -o "OrangePi_BM.elf"  ./main.o

A tricky part was getting the PORT L pins to work as it's located on the R_PIO module. This R_PIO clock comes from an undocumented:

CPUS_CLK_BASE_ADDR (0x01f01400)

CPUS_APB0_GATE     *(volatile unsigned int*)(CPUS_CLK_BASE_ADDR + 0x28)

R_PIO Gate is bit0 which must be set before the R_PIO/PORTL registers can be touched.



Loading:

use uBoot to load this.

arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary "OPiBareMetal.elf"  "OPiBareMetal.bin"

copy this bin to an SD Card to say /boot


in uboot:

load mmc 0:1 0x40000000 /boot/OPiBareMetal.bin

go 0x40000000
